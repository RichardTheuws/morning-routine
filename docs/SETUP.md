### Step 3: Copy Your API Key
Your API key will look like this:

```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

## üåê Production Deployment

### Netlify (Recommended)
1. **Connect your GitHub repository** to Netlify
2. **Set environment variables** in Netlify dashboard:
   - Go to Site Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
   - Add `VITE_PEXELS_API_KEY` with your API key
3. **Deploy** - Netlify will automatically build and deploy

### Vercel
1. **Import your GitHub repository** to Vercel
2. **Add environment variables** in project settings:
   - Add `VITE_PEXELS_API_KEY` with your API key
3. **Deploy** - Vercel will handle the build process

### Other Hosting Providers
For any static hosting provider:
1. **Build the project:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
2. **Upload the `dist` folder** to your hosting provider
3. **Set environment variables** if supported by your provider

## üîß Configuration Options

### Environment Variables

*Required for video demonstrations. App works without it but with limited visual content.

### PWA Configuration
The app is configured as a Progressive Web App (PWA) by default. Users can install it on their devices for a native app experience.

To customize PWA settings, edit:
